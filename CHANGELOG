# 0.16.0 - 2021-02-12
- Added a watch mode that rebuilds your website and reloads the browser as well.
  This functionality does depend on a globally installed lite-server,
  https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server.

# 0.15.0 - 2021-02-11
- The Slugify dependency has been removed and replaced with my own very basic slugified 
  computed property on String. This makes quite a big speed difference!

# 0.14.0 - 2021-02-10
- Saga no longer comes bundled with a default markdown reader - you install one yourself:
  - https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaParsleyMarkdownReader
  - https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaPythonMarkdownReader
  - https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaInkMarkdownReader
- The writers now have a different function signature. They no longer simply take a templatePath,
  Instead they expect a function that is given a RenderingContext and must return a String.
  This should make it possible to use any kind of renderer you want, where you want to use swift-html,
  Plot, Swim or Stencil. As long as you can turn a RenderingContext into a String, it'll work.
  One renderer that is available is https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaSwimRenderer.

# 0.13.0 - 2021-02-09
- Switched away from SwiftMarkdown to Parsley, which is a LOT faster, see https://github.com/loopwerk/Saga/pull/5.
  Sadly it doesn't do syntax highlighting, so a client side solution such as prism.js is very handy.

# 0.12.0 - 2021-02-07
- Updated to latest version of SwiftMarkdown and now using its urlize extension

# 0.11.0 - 2021-02-07
- Fixed Stencil filters when compiling your site under Linux

# 0.10.0 - 2021-02-07
- Refactored the `keepExactPath` parameter of the writer into a better
  documented `PageWriteMode` enum that's part of the `register` function.
  This is because we need those destination paths for all pages before the
  first writer even starts its thing.

# 0.9.0 - 2021-02-07
- Changed the numberOfWords, the old version didn't work on Linux
  (`error: 'byWords' is unavailable: Enumeration by words isn't supported in swift-corelibs-foundation`)

# 0.8.0 - 2021-02-07
- Replaced Ink and Stencil with SwiftMarkdown, see https://github.com/loopwerk/Saga/pull/3.
  If you want to keep using Ink and Stencil, check out https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaInkMarkdownReader.
- Added a way to supply custom `SiteMetadata`, which will be given to every template
- Added `striptags`, `wordcount`, `slugify`, `escape` and `truncate` filters for Stencil
- Made some previously `internal` things `public`

# 0.7.0 - 2021-02-03
- Complete API redesign, see https://github.com/loopwerk/Saga/pull/1

# 0.6.0 - 2021-02-02
- Pages can set their own custom template

# 0.5.0 - 2021-02-02
