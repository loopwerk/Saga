# Architecture

An overview of how Saga works.


## Overview
Saga does its work in multiple stages.

1. First, it finds all the files within the `input` folder
2. Then, for every registered step, it passes those files to a matching ``Reader``. These readers turn text files (such as Markdown or RestructuredText files) into `Item` instances.
3. Finally Saga runs all the registered steps again, now executing the ``Writer``s. These writers turn a rendering context (which holds the ``Item`` among other things) into a `String` using a "renderer", which it'll then write to disk, to the `output` folder.

Saga does not come with any readers or renderers out of the box. The official recommendation is to use [SagaParsleyMarkdownReader](https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaParsleyMarkdownReader) for reading Markdown files using [Parsley](https://github.com/loopwerk/Parsley), and [SagaSwimRenderer](https://github.com/loopwerk/SagaSwimRenderer) to render them using [Swim](https://github.com/robb/Swim), which offers a great HTML DSL using Swift's function builders. 

Please check the <doc:Installation> instructions, or check out the [Example project](https://github.com/loopwerk/Saga/blob/main/Example) to get an idea of how Saga works with Parsley and Swim.
